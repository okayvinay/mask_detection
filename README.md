# Mask Detection

## How to properly wear a face mask?

<br/>
We have all seen it, people wearing masks under their chins, not at all, or even with their noses hanging out. 

For this capstone I am exloring Convolutional Neural Networks and their ability to classify images. My goal is to build a model that will be able to detect whether or not and individual is wearing a face mask "properly". By "properly" I mean covering the face and nose.

## Background and Motivation

For a better part of a year now we have been dealing with with masks due to this Covid pandemic. This period of time has had all kinds of controvesry but nothing as innocuous as wearing a mask! There have been many debates about how to wear a mask properly and whether it prevents you from getting oxygen. 

We have all been there at a grocery store and someone is either wearing a mask with their nose hanging out of the top of their mask (What do they think happens when you sneeze?)

I do believe this has a real world use case, we can track and record how many people are wearing masks correctly, incorrectly, or not at all see what the impact of the virus transmission is with enough data. 

## The Data

[This](https://www.kaggle.com/spandanpatnaik09/face-mask-detectormask-not-mask-incorrect-mask) is the data set I am using

It is broken down into 3 categories:

1. People wearing mask
2. People not wearing mask
3. People wearing mask but in an incorrect manner

This dataset set contains 2089 images.
